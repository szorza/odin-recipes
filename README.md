This is the basic HTML project for and from TOP.

By the end of this I should have a recipe for a website that will serve as a springboard for CSS lessons in the future. My current goal of understanding Git, terminology, why things work as they do, and how to do it myself is trucking along nicely though in the process I'm finding once again that more you learn the more you must learn, sometimes through fumbling.

I have thus far learned that the seeds of old HTML and Visual Basic studies, and DOS CLI experience, are bearing fruit.
